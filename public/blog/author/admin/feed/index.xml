			<p>Though <a href="https://www.hasotech.com/hybrid-mobile-app-development-considered-underrated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hybrid Mobile App development considered underrated</a>, There are still many Hybrid Mobile apps are being developed. Being Hybrid Mobile App Developers, <a href="https://www.hasotech.com/why-we-love-hybrid-mobile-app-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we love Hybrid Mobile App Development.</a> There are many popular apps like Amazon, Uber, Evernote, Facebook etc., The frameworks used to develop Hybrid apps makes Hybrid Mobile app developers easy to make it. To develop a successful mobile app, Hybrid Mobile app developers should follow some <a href="https://www.hasotech.com/secrets-successful-hybrid-mobile-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">secret methods</a>. Though there are many frameworks available to develop Hybrid Mobile apps like <a href="https://www.hasotech.com/ionic-mobile-app-developer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ionic Framework</a>, There are some tips for Hybrid Mobile App developers to follow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Choose the Right Framework</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>When going with Hybrid Mobile app development, Choosing the right framework to develop is very important. There are many frameworks available. Some of them are Ionic Framework, React Native, Xamarin, PhoneGap etc., The very confusion moment is choosing between Ionic Framework or React Native. Ionic Framework is on Angular 4 and React Native is on React js. Since both are booming in the market, It&#8217;s hard to choose the right one.</li>
<li>Anyways, The purpose of developing the Hybrid Mobile App can define it. If you are looking to develop both Web and Mobile app, Then our suggestion is to go with Ionic Framework. Since it is on Angular JS which can be used in both Web and Mobile App, Number of resources to be used can be reduced.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><a href="https://www.web.hasotech.com/why-we-love-hybrid-mobile-app-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">We Love Hybrid Mobile App Development</a></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a licensing Problem with React Native. It license says They can make it to full premium version anytime. So before choosing React Native, Make sure you can able to overcome the license problem.</li>
<li>If you are a .NET / C# Developer, Then the only option is Xamarin. Xamarin is a Microsoft product which uses C# as a base language to develop Hybrid Mobile app. Of course, You need Visual Studio tools to complete the development.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ionic Framework &#8211; Lazy Loading Issue</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are using Ionic Framework, Then you might be facing Lazy Loading issue in the new version. Still, Ionic Framework is working on it to overcome, There are some ways to fix the issue on our own. Instead of declaring all the Nodule Modules in the Main and pages where the node modules to be implemented. Declare the Node modules only in the pages. As the number of Node Modules increases on the Main page, The Lazy Loading time increases.</li>
<li>It is better to avoid unwanted node modules on the main page.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><a href="https://www.web.hasotech.com/not-go-hybrid-mobile-app-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Don’t go with Hybrid Mobile App Development</a></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Choosing the right Plugins</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>When we come to Hybrid Mobile App development, Definitely it is going to be on both Android and iOS and sometimes in Windows. While deploying the app to different platforms Plugins may get conflict. Some plugins may support only in Android and not on iOS.</li>
<li>Before choosing a plugin to implement the native function in Mobile App, Make sure it supports in all the platforms.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Checklist for Hybrid Mobile App Developers</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Before choosing Hybrid App, Make sure the requirement can be done in Hybrid. If there are more native functions or if the app is very complex, It is suggested to go with Native. But still, if you want to go with Hybrid, Then make sure the app is being developed with proper performance check.</li>
<li>Inspect the App in chrome browser and check for Network and console logs. Try creating the apps without any error in console logs. As the error increases, It may affect the performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.web.hasotech.com/hybridmobileapp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hybrid Mobile App Development </a></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Make proper performance check in the browser and Mobile App testing before deploying in Play store or App store.</li>
<li>If the mobile app is targeted for lower versions of Android or iOS, Then Hybrid App is not the right choice. Hybrid Apps are meant for Android Lollipop versions and above and iOS 10. Though it supports from Jellybean, It is suggested to with Lollipop target.</li>
</ul>

			<p>We have been talking Hybrid Mobile App development in <a href="http://www.hasotech.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many articles</a>. You might be wondering what&#8217;s in Hybrid Mobile App Development and what makes <a href="http://www.hasotech.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hasoians</a> to write more articles on it.

<p>Hybrid Application development always reduces the development time and cost which made many of our clients beneficiary. And recent updates of Hybrid Application development makes deployment on Web and as Desktop Applications too.</p>
<h3>What can a Hybrid Mobile App do?</h3>
<p>The same thing as explained in other articles before. With Hybrid Mobile App development we can able to deploy on different platforms. Oh, wait, not only on web platforms, Now we can able to deploy it as Desktop Application and Web Application.</p>
<h4 class="stripe_2"><a href="https://www.hasotech.com/secrets-successful-hybrid-mobile-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Secrets of the Successful Hybrid Mobile Apps</a></h4>
<p>Progressive Web Apps are the next generation of web applications. Since the usage of mobile phones has been increased drastically. All the web applications are being developed with complete mobile optimized. But making the UI (User Interface) alone as mobile-optimized is not enough. There are lots of things to be considered for making a Mobile Optimized Web applications and that comes with Progressive Web Apps.</p>
<p>So what? <strong>Can a Hybrid Mobile App development help to make a Progressive Web Apps?</strong></p>
<p>Yes of course, why not? Hybrid apps are web nature.</p>
<h3>Hybrid Mobile App as Desktop App?</h3>
<p>And again the same answer, Why not? There are many Hybrid Desktop existing but the beauty part is. When you can deploy the code that you made for mobile application as a Desktop application. Hybrid Mobile App development can make it.</p>

<li>Windows Desktop Applications</li>
<li>Progressive Web Applications</li>

</ul>
<h3>Does Hybrid Mobile App Development support Native Mobile Functions?</h3>
<p>One of the reasons why some hesitate to go with Hybrid Mobile App development is, worrying about native functions. Like NativeMobile Application Development uses libraries to access native functions like camera, Bluetooth, NFC, Fingerprint etc.,  Hybrid Mobile App development is with many plugins which help to access all the native functions.</p>
<p>So, No worries about using Native functions in Hybrid Apps.</p>
<h3>What about Hybrid Mobile App Performance?</h3>
<p>Another main reason, Why some developers hesitate to use Hybrid platforms. When we compare the performance of Native Mobile Application and Hybrid Mobile Application, Always native performance is great. But it doesn&#8217;t mean that Hybrid Mobile app performance is very low. There might be some milliseconds lags between a Native and Hybrid Mobile applications. But is it possible to develop a Good standard application?  Experienced Hybrid Mobile app developer can make it.</p>
<h4 class="stripe_2"><a href="https://www.hasotech.com/not-go-hybrid-mobile-app-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Don’t go with Hybrid Mobile App Development</a></h4>

			<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">The scope of Mobile App Development has been increasing day by day. There are Billions of Applications in Google Play store and Millions of application in App store. And many of them are in Hybrid Mobile App Development Platforms. The main reason for such amount of application in Google Play store and App store is the simplicity of Application development. Developing application has become easier one and also everyone started expressing their ideas through mobile apps. There are many technologies available to develop a mobile application. and certain drag and drop tools helps to develop a mobile application without a single line of code. </span></p>
<h4 class="stripe_2"><a href="https://www.hasotech.com/hybrid-mobile-application-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Get to know more about Hybrid Mobile Application Development</a></h4>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Though there are many technologies available to develop a mobile application. Hybrid Mobile Application Development is one of the trending development platforms. With Native Mobile Application Development. One can able to develop a mobile app for one platform either on Android or iOS. But With Hybrid Mobile Application Development. It has made easy to develop the application and deploy it on different platforms with a single code. </span></p>
<h3>What is Hybrid Mobile App Development</h3>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">If you can able to deploy an application on multiple platforms like Android, iOS, Windows etc., with a single code. For Example, If we are about to develop <strong><a href="https://www.web.hasotech.com/how-to-get-free-magento-2-mobile-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Magento E-commerce Mobile Application</a> </strong>in Android iOS, Then probably Hybrid Mobile Application might be the right choice.  With this we can able to deploy the application on both Android and iOS. Whereas if we choose to go with Native Mobile Application development. Then both Android and iOS have to be developed separately. And also the cost and time of developing Native Mobile application would be high. </span></p>
<h4 class="stripe_2"><a href="https://www.web.hasotech.com/whats-crazy-mobile-app-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What’s crazy on Mobile App Development</a></h4>
<h3>Why Hybrid Mobile App Development is underrated!!</h3>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">And here we come to core concept of the article. Why Is Hybrid Mobile App Development Considered Underrated?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">The main reason is the Frameworks. Ther are many frameworks available to develop Hybrid Mobile applications like Ionic Framework, React Native, Xamarin, Titanium, and the mother of all frameworks, PhoneGap. Though there are many frameworks, All the frameworks are not good as to develop a standard application.

			<p>Mobile apps are one of the best ways for making money. But not all the business apps or Hybrid Mobile apps are successful. If you are looking to develop a successful mobile app, that too in the Hybrid platform.  Then you must know these secrets of the successful Hybrid Mobile Apps. We have gone through several Hybrid Mobile apps that are running successfully. And we came up with some secrets that actually made those apps successful.</p>
<h2>Choosing the Right Platform</h2>
<p>When it comes to Hybrid Mobile App Development, choosing the right framework is the most important one. There are many frameworks available and PhoneGap is the mother of all. However, PhoneGap has become outdated one and there are many new frameworks with more features. Some of them are Ionic Framework, Xamarin, Unity, Titanium. Most of the Hybrid apps are powered by Cordova backbone. Out of all these frameworks, Ionic Framework is said to be the best one which provides many components and plugins. If you are a c# Developer then you may go with Xamarin or Unity. And Unity is must if you are looking at developing games.</p>

<h2>Designing Hybrid Mobile Apps</h2>
<p>The more the app is user-friendly with good user experience, The more that app will be a successful one. Though there are many ready designs are available. It is better to go with a unique design which is impressive. Ionic Framework is providing many UI components which made the designing bit easier. The more we make easy to use the app and understand the concept of the app, The more chance for the success we will get.</p>

<h2>Why Hybrid Mobile Apps</h2>
<p>This might be the first question while reading this article. Though there are native platforms available for developing Android and iOS applications. There must be a special reason to choose Hybrid mobile platform. If you are looking to make the application on a different platform in short period of time. And also in low budget, then the Hybrid platform is the best one.</p>

<h2>Choosing the right Niche</h2>
<p>Focusing on particular Niche will increase the chance of getting the app success. The more the app solves a particular problem, The more the app will get succeed. Most of the successful apps are concentrating on a very specific niche and Solving a specific problem. Also making the app more interactive and entertainment will get more user engagement.</p>
<h2>Making the Revenue Model</h2>
<p>The revenue model and the amount of revenue of an application decides the success of an app. The more revenue it gets, The more success the app is. Concentrating more on attracting a huge range of customers automatically increase revenue. More customers =  More revenue. With the ads in free app version, or launching business driving model with app surely will help for more revenue.</p>
<p>Shameless marketing is more important. After making the app with perfect UI and good revenue model, Marketing has to be done in proper way. The amount and time used to develop the application, Double it in marketing for a good reach.</p>

			<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">The scope of Cross Platform Mobile App Development has been increasing. And the range of developing multi-platform applications is also increasing. Cross platform mobile app development is not something web app. Creating web app is different and Creating Hybrid or cross platform mobile app development. HTML5 app development is basically mentioned as a Web app. And using some frameworks to develop the mobile app is different.

<h3><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;">Ionic Framework</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Ionic Framework is one of the popular Cross-platform app development frameworks. This framework has been coming up with regular updates with lots of bug fixes. The recent launch iPhone X screen can be supported by this framework.  This app is completely based on Angular which is well-grooming technology and it is powered by cordova.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;">Xamarin</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">As like Ionic Framework, Xamarin is one of the best frameworks for developing the cross-platform mobile app. Xamarin is purely based on C# Microsoft technology. If you are looking to move to enterprise edition app then you may go with Xamarin rather than going with Open source technology.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;">Unity</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Unity Frameworks are for Game Developers. If your application is going to use many animated modules. If you are planning to develop a game on multiple platforms, Then unity is the best choice.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;">Pros and Cons of Cross-Platform Mobile App Development</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">The biggest advance of going to Cross-Platform Mobile App Development is cost and time. If you are looking to develop the multiplatform app in less time or cost then it is the best choice</span></li>
