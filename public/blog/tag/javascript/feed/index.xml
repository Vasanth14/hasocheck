<p>Customers nowadays should be able to provide the best mobile experience for their visitors. Some companies thus opt not to apply native. We shall present another new technology called Progressive Web Apps in this post (PWAs). We discover how Progressive Web App operates, how they overcome the problems and weaknesses of PWA applications.</p>



<p>Progressive web apps (PWAs) are a fascinating technology that can revolutionize the way we create mobile and online applications. Some people may suggest though that PWA is only a website that&#8217;s turned into a mobile app, while some people argue about its capacity, safety, and performance.</p>



<p>So, This article explains the <strong>pros and cons of Progressive web apps</strong>, useful for your future web and mobile apps.</p>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color" style="font-size:33px"><strong>What Is Progressive Web App?</strong></p>



<p>The progressive web app provides a user-like mobile experience. Therefore, the UX is tailored for the PWA device to provide the greatest information and features.</p>



<p>PWA is accessed by web users to enable consumers access to important native features, such as mobile home screen application, offline access, PWA notices of push</p>



<p>PWA allows web apps to load, synchronize and smoothly execute things when no network is present while giving your users a native experience.</p>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color" style="font-size:30px"><strong>Advantages Of Progressive Web App</strong></p>



<p><strong>PWAs are cheaper than other apps</strong></p>



<p>Material has to be generated only once, which saves time and money by making content for iOS, Android and a website individually. In addition, PWAs need not be updated (some find this feature specifically cool). No new information needs to be downloaded by users. You don&#8217;t have to worry about their development if a PWA is operating.</p>



<p><strong>Reliable</strong></p>



<p>When loading, the app should be bright and should be shut and open if there is not a network or a relatively low-speed network like 2G. Google discovered if the page was loaded longer than 3 seconds, that 53% of people left the website.</p>



<p><strong>User friendly</strong></p>



<p>You don&#8217;t depend on app stores with PWAs. Search engines and other platforms can find PWAs. You may also provide a PWA on social networks, on your homepage, or through another element of your ecosystem. However, app stores offer the benefit of being able to reach a wide public in one shot.</p>



<p><strong>Installable</strong></p>



<p>If we want to bring web apps closer to native applications, they must be installed and reside with other native applications on the home screen, so that the user can use PWA with only one click.</p>



<p><strong>Splash Screen</strong></p>



<p>Adds a splash screen upon starting the app to the progressive Web App. That makes the PWA more resemble a native application.</p>



<p><strong>Highly engage-able</strong></p>



<p>Users should remain engaged with the app. PWA offers features such as push notifications to help users glorify their commitment, home screen icon, the full screen, and offline-first app.</p>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color" style="font-size:25px"><strong>Disadvantage Of Progressive Web App</strong></p>



<p><strong>Drains battery power</strong></p>



<p>Since the phones have to work harder to comprehend the code, as they are written in complicated codes. This is why PWAs use more battery compared to native applications. So, consumers don&#8217;t worry about their battery life anymore and may not have to download such an application.</p>



<p><strong>Unable to access various device features&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>PWAs do not have access to numerous functionalities on your smartphone, therefore they are behind native applications. No access to NFC devices and also Bluetooth devices, sophisticated camera settings and so much more is available to PWAs. This means that the application is less than optimal for users.</p>



<p><strong>No access to app stores</strong></p>



<p>You are not exposed in an Apple or Android application store as a corporation if you build a <a href="https://medium.com/weekly-webtips/create-a-progressive-web-app-a-quick-tutorial-7e3b4e9c040a">PWA</a>. Apps are frequently identified since they appear on one of the renowned app marketplaces. Therefore, it is a significant drawback that this &#8220;springboard&#8221; cannot be used by a wider public.</p>



<p><strong>Functionalities&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Fewer and consequently less UX functionality. These web apps offer less functionality, unlike native apps. On Apple devices, iOS does not support complete PWAs functionality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This means that many users have restricted choices for PWAs, which is a pity. A lack of experience in UX (user experience) is a genuine loss at least as important in a world as the marketing of the product itself.</p>



<p><strong>Lesser technical option</strong></p>



<p>It is not possible to apply to PWAs all technical alternatives, such as Bluetooth or Near Field Communication (NFC). This implies that the applications you may have for your application are restricted. The question is whether PWAs can also make use of other future advances.</p>



<h4 style="font-size:22px">Conclusion</h4>



<p>Using the Progressive Web App you have read the benefits and cons for development. In the end, it is vital that you have your application supported and solved problems on time by the proper PWA app development firm.</p>

<p>Many modifications to JavaScript&#8217;s increased popularity and today&#8217;s web development landscape have been drastically different. NodeJS has not only been a JavaScript altercation but is built mostly on it.</p>



<p>NodeJS was then created and with quickness turned the minds of the developers. JavaScript was not just faster than anybody imagined on the server, but often It was quicker than Java and other choices.</p>



<p>Since then, its constant diet of tiny, rapid, infinite data requests has increased the dynamism of NodeJS websites. It currently plays a key role in the technological pool of many leading firms that rely on its advantages.</p>



<p>In this article, We&#8217;ll cover &#8220;why to select NodeJS to create an application?&#8221; We will see What is NodeJS before we enter the topic?</p>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color" style="font-size:35px"><strong>What Is NodeJS?</strong></p>



<p>NodeJS is open and free, utilized by thousands of developers worldwide. It adds several advantages to the table, making it superior to other platforms on the server, such as Java or PHP.</p>



<p>It is a strong JavaScript-based framework for developing online chat apps, video streaming sites, single-page apps, and several other I/O-intensive web applications and web applications. It&#8217;ll be utilized by major, established firms and freshly formed boot stocks, based on Google Chrome&#8217;s JavaScript V8 engine.</p>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color" style="font-size:33px"><strong>What Makes NodeJS a Powerful Technology?</strong></p>



<p>NodeJS components include V8, libuv, C-ares, HTTP-parser, OpenSSL, and Zlib. While it is appreciated the attention of developers from its inception and has been utilized in real-time applications excellently. NodeJS is without a doubt a unique collection of capabilities that have helped developers make it their favorite choice for the creation of online apps.</p>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color" style="font-size:30px"><strong>Why Choose NodeJS?</strong></p>



<ul><li>NodeJS works together to smoothly develop the front-end parts of an application with business-level web technology like ReactJS and AngularJS.</li><li>NodeJS works with a wide variety of popular framework systems, such as Express.js, Connect, and Socket.io.</li><li>NodeJS features a robust ecosystem of thousands of open-source libraries hosted on the NPM site.</li><li>Great community and support for developers.</li><li>NodeJS, based on Google V8 JavaScript, can be handled incredibly quickly and easily.</li><li>All tools operate on NodeJS based on JavaScript.</li></ul>



<h5>Benefits Of NodeJS</h5>



<p><strong>High Performance and Event-Based Model</strong></p>



<p>With their quick growth, the companies are searching for frameworks that can be readily adapted and scaled as the user base expands and that NodeJS can accommodate any audience.</p>



<p>It is a favorite choice for different solutions that demand rapid changes in data such as chats, video conferencing, and more, whether it concerns non-blocking replies, single-theme nature, or the use of a common language for both Client and Server.</p>



<p><strong>Runtime environment</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>NodeJS allows the programming of the server using JavaScript. This involves little overhead for most boot stapping tasks that you need to perform to create a server application. However, the framework you want to utilize still has to be determined.</p>



<p>You may discover several blog entries on whether performance, speed, usability, and so on are superior based. However, the option ultimately depends on the individual preferences of the developer.</p>



<p><strong>Easy Maintenance</strong></p>



<p>Since software developing businesses nowadays have a specialized team of experts to support server administration and maintenance, why are NodeJS&#8217;s server-free and hardware-free options for you complicated?. This reduces time and costs and improves developers and software development firms&#8217; efficiency and productivity in this context.</p>



<p><strong>Single Programming Language</strong></p>



<p>NodeJS delivers a front-end and back-end Javascript cocktail of comparable languages. It is easier to access, more versatile than it seems. It robustly and seamlessly makes the whole web app development cycle for developers and companies.</p>



<p>It spares more useful and lucrative time, energy, and human-hour commitment. This conveniently creates web apps and makes them the most favored technology now on the market.</p>



<p><strong>Developing Cross-Platform Apps With NodeJS</strong></p>



<p>Platforms like Electron and NW.js have offered a new method to use NodeJS-style <a href="https://instabug.com/blog/cross-platform-development/">cross-platform apps.</a> You may now use a few code lines from your online applications to construct desktop programs using NodeJS, especially for macOS, Windows, and Linux.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-black-color has-text-color" style="font-size:25px"><strong><a href="https://hasotech.com/cross-platform-mobile-app-development-things-to-know/">Cross-Platform Mobile App Development – Things To Know</a></strong></p>



<p><strong>Scalable systems</strong></p>



<p>The lightweight nature of NodeJS facilitates the horizontal measurement of apps by launching several project instances on various hosts. You may also grow the system upwards utilizing a module that incorporates a cluster, which forks all the CPUs you have for the application process.</p>



<h6>NodeJS based business solutions</h6>



<p><strong>Real-time Web Applications</strong></p>



<p>NodeJS may also be used to construct web apps in real-time, such as a chat room in which users can speak with one another in real-time since it is particularly good at managing a lot of I/O activities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Or perhaps a tool of cooperation where employees work simultaneously on the same paper. Done! Constructing a web application for video conferencing won&#8217;t be an issue either. The Node Events API and WebSockets make it feasible.</p>



<p><strong>Chat Application</strong></p>



<p>Chat is the most common multi-user application in real-time. The capacity of IRC to implement anything now in NodeJS, using several proprietary open Protocols operating on non-standard port 80 over WebSockets with a standard port 80 function.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The chat application is NodeJS&#8217;s sweet example: a lightweight and high-data application running across dispersed devices.</p>



<p><strong>Server-side Web Applications</strong></p>



<p>It may also be used with Express.js for generating traditional server web applications. This request-response paradigm, however, in which NodeJS carries rendered HTML is not the most frequent use-case. This method must be supported and opposed by arguments.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Backend for Social Media Networking</strong></p>



<p>On NodeJS several well-known names are reconstructed like LinkedIn and Medium. A key mix of nodes is provided to construct a backend for a social media website. It offers its V8 engine and secure authentication for flashing fast routing. The scalability of a network of social media is one of the most important elements.</p>



<p><strong>Data Streaming</strong></p>



<p>This was embraced by giants to service 190 countries, with more than 100 million hours streaming and counting over 120 million users. NodeJS has a distinct edge as super-fast processing of files and encodes and uploads of plumbing. Many e-Shops and applications with enormous data streaming videos have been involved in this.</p>



<h6>Conclusion</h6>



<p>So I see significant grounds for NodeJS&#8217;s choice of web apps for a seamless and good user experience with the above-mentioned futuristic characteristics.</p>
