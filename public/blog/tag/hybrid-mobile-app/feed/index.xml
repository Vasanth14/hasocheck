										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Businesses worldwide desire an advanced mobile app on their Android and iOS platforms to serve their company. Most of them are caught in the middle where they have difficulty selecting the ideal technologies like ionic, hybrid, native for themselves. </p>



<p>Each approach to technology and development has its pros and cons, from which you have to select the best solution for your company. If you think Ionic is the correct platform application development, below are a few advantages and disadvantages of Ionic development.</p>



<p>Ionic Framework helps us to develop apps using only one codebase for several platforms. Let us learn how it works and what are this solution&#8217;s benefits and downsides. The frameworks are quite popular, however, in this blog, we will focus on the advantages and disadvantages of ionic application development. Let&#8217;s get right in with that statement!</p>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><br><strong>What is an Ionic Application?</strong></p>



<p>It is used to build <a href="https://hasotech.com/why-we-love-hybrid-mobile-app-development/">hybrid mobile apps </a>using the Open Source Software Development Kit(SDK). It is fully Apache Cordova and Angular based on this ionic framework. More specifically, Ionic is an npm module that requires Node JS to be installed.</p>



<p>The conditions for building these applications are excellent HTML, CSS and JavaScript commands. Because of their suitable properties and usefulness, many developers today opt for ionic frameworks. The main objective is to construct a hybrid mobile app in ionic framework development.</p>



<p>Hybrid applications provide several advantages compared with native applications, in particular in terms of development time. Essentially, the construction of ionic apps allows the captivating design and soft animations of native mobile components.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-black-color has-text-color has-large-font-size"><strong><a href="http://Ionic/ Mobile App Developer">Ionic Mobile App Developer</a></strong></p>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><br><strong>Ionic Applications</strong> <strong>Are</strong></p>



<p><br>●<strong> <a href="https://uptech.team/blog/native-vs-cross-platform-app-development">The cross-platform </a></strong>– single code base for both platforms (except native components)</p>



<p>● <strong>Web-based </strong>– Built using web-views and can be displayed in a browser like PWAs.</p>



<p>● <strong>Access to native API components</strong> – They can access the native device’s cameras, files, and others.</p>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><br><strong>Advantages Of Ionic Application</strong></p>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-normal-font-size"><strong>A single codebase across various platforms</strong></p>



<p>It was developed using the Angular and Apache Cordova frame and used as the fundamental technologies for app development HTML 5, CSS, and JavaScript. Alongside the current release of the Ionic, you may utilize Angular with all its advantages and disadvantages for the first time.</p>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-normal-font-size"><strong>Free Open Source Framework</strong></p>



<p>This frame is an open-source framework that is entirely free. Ionic framework applications offer platform-specific, optimized CSS features to match the native appearance of the different mobile operating systems. This Framework offers one of the primary advantages in the provision of CSS, HTML, and JS mobile-optimized code and reducing code rewriting needs.</p>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-normal-font-size"><strong>Cross Mobile App Development</strong></p>



<p>In application development, the development of efficient, compatible, and bespoke apps is of major importance. Ionic integrates with AngularJS, which enhances the interoperability of this code with mobile platforms. Ionic helps to swiftly create apps that make the app more popular and save time and money.</p>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-normal-font-size"><strong>Testing convenience</strong></p>



<p>While Ionic Apps only operate via a review, the browser of the device may be used to test the app. It is much handier because test equipment does not even need to be used to make sure it is all working properly. The same principle applies in the current world to a range of mobile devices.</p>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-normal-font-size"><strong>Appealing Default UI</strong></p>



<p>There are numerous common JavaScript and CSS components in these Framework apps covering many fundamental elements that would like to be developed by a moving app. The menu slides, inputs, buttons, lists, navigation, tab, sliding box, and pop-ups. standard styles are clean and simple, and developers may simply change them by adding CSS classes that have been given by the user to the device.</p>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-normal-font-size"><strong>Quick Development and Time To Market</strong></p>



<p>This development may benefit entrepreneurs and company owners when comparing a mobile app with native apps on both platforms in a short time. Constructing native apps particularly for each platform can take time, which can lead to a market delay and the cost of development of native applications is sometimes costly.</p>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><br><strong>Disadvantages Of Ionic Application</strong></p>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-normal-font-size"><strong>Performance Issue</strong></p>



<p>The performance of heavy apps is inappropriate for this application. When created with this Framework, apps with heavy realism or heavy graphics might crash.</p>



<p>The major reason behind this is that this application makes its graphics using a browser that does many stages on the screen.</p>



<p>There are, then, study performance optimization strategies to achieve better outcomes if you still want to develop a high-performance application utilizing Ionic.</p>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-normal-font-size"><strong>Security Issues</strong></p>



<p>You must not regard it as a con of this application on your own, but rather the possibility of a hazard with which you have to cope. </p>



<p>Security is a typical problem for the creation of hybrid apps as long as your program can be reversed. Ionic CLI is a prevalent approach since version 4 that makes the code tough for hackers to understand.</p>



<p> But you must also realize that there is no code uglification when you use Angular CLI or earlier versions of Ionic. The code will have to be Uglified by your developers yourself.</p>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-normal-font-size"><strong>Dependency on Plugins</strong></p>



<p>Even Ionic app development firms would admit that they must rely on plugins to have access to native features. You won&#8217;t be able to locate a corresponding plugin in the ionic toolset in some situations.</p>



<p>To build a plugin for very specialized features and functions, you must use the Ionic App development company. </p>



<p>If there is no plug-in, you will be able to discover a module most commonly. You&#8217;d probably have to make something that&#8217;s not in store with the aid of a native developer.</p>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-normal-font-size"><strong>Hot Reloading not Available</strong></p>



<p>To make modifications to the application code, this platform employs a variety of approaches. Hot reloading is regarded as a vital characteristic in the software engineering industry. </p>



<p>Because it allows you to make changes without having to refresh the entire program. It takes some getting accustomed to because it does not support hot reloading and instead relies on live reloading. </p>



<p>When you make changes, live reloading will refresh the whole app to make the changes active. That implies that whenever your developers wish to make changes, their program will be restarted.</p>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><strong>conclusion</strong></p>



<p>For your development, you have reviewed the pros and cons of utilizing this framework. Finally, it is crucial to have your application supported and problems solved on time by the proper Ionic application development firm.</p>



<p><em>If you are looking to<a href="https://hasotech.com/contact-us/"> hire an ionic application developer for your application</a>, you can consult our development experts and understand how we can convert your idea into reality.</em></p>

<p>Customers nowadays should be able to provide the best mobile experience for their visitors. Some companies thus opt not to apply native. We shall present another new technology called Progressive Web Apps in this post (PWAs). We discover how Progressive Web App operates, how they overcome the problems and weaknesses of PWA applications.</p>



<p>Progressive web apps (PWAs) are a fascinating technology that can revolutionize the way we create mobile and online applications. Some people may suggest though that PWA is only a website that&#8217;s turned into a mobile app, while some people argue about its capacity, safety, and performance.</p>



<p>So, This article explains the <strong>pros and cons of Progressive web apps</strong>, useful for your future web and mobile apps.</p>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color" style="font-size:33px"><strong>What Is Progressive Web App?</strong></p>



<p>The progressive web app provides a user-like mobile experience. Therefore, the UX is tailored for the PWA device to provide the greatest information and features.</p>



<p>PWA is accessed by web users to enable consumers access to important native features, such as mobile home screen application, offline access, PWA notices of push</p>



<p>PWA allows web apps to load, synchronize and smoothly execute things when no network is present while giving your users a native experience.</p>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color" style="font-size:30px"><strong>Advantages Of Progressive Web App</strong></p>



<p><strong>PWAs are cheaper than other apps</strong></p>



<p>Material has to be generated only once, which saves time and money by making content for iOS, Android and a website individually. In addition, PWAs need not be updated (some find this feature specifically cool). No new information needs to be downloaded by users. You don&#8217;t have to worry about their development if a PWA is operating.</p>



<p><strong>Reliable</strong></p>



<p>When loading, the app should be bright and should be shut and open if there is not a network or a relatively low-speed network like 2G. Google discovered if the page was loaded longer than 3 seconds, that 53% of people left the website.</p>



<p><strong>User friendly</strong></p>



<p>You don&#8217;t depend on app stores with PWAs. Search engines and other platforms can find PWAs. You may also provide a PWA on social networks, on your homepage, or through another element of your ecosystem. However, app stores offer the benefit of being able to reach a wide public in one shot.</p>



<p><strong>Installable</strong></p>



<p>If we want to bring web apps closer to native applications, they must be installed and reside with other native applications on the home screen, so that the user can use PWA with only one click.</p>



<p><strong>Splash Screen</strong></p>



<p>Adds a splash screen upon starting the app to the progressive Web App. That makes the PWA more resemble a native application.</p>



<p><strong>Highly engage-able</strong></p>



<p>Users should remain engaged with the app. PWA offers features such as push notifications to help users glorify their commitment, home screen icon, the full screen, and offline-first app.</p>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color" style="font-size:25px"><strong>Disadvantage Of Progressive Web App</strong></p>



<p><strong>Drains battery power</strong></p>



<p>Since the phones have to work harder to comprehend the code, as they are written in complicated codes. This is why PWAs use more battery compared to native applications. So, consumers don&#8217;t worry about their battery life anymore and may not have to download such an application.</p>



<p><strong>Unable to access various device features&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>PWAs do not have access to numerous functionalities on your smartphone, therefore they are behind native applications. No access to NFC devices and also Bluetooth devices, sophisticated camera settings and so much more is available to PWAs. This means that the application is less than optimal for users.</p>



<p><strong>No access to app stores</strong></p>



<p>You are not exposed in an Apple or Android application store as a corporation if you build a <a href="https://medium.com/weekly-webtips/create-a-progressive-web-app-a-quick-tutorial-7e3b4e9c040a">PWA</a>. Apps are frequently identified since they appear on one of the renowned app marketplaces. Therefore, it is a significant drawback that this &#8220;springboard&#8221; cannot be used by a wider public.</p>



<p><strong>Functionalities&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Fewer and consequently less UX functionality. These web apps offer less functionality, unlike native apps. On Apple devices, iOS does not support complete PWAs functionality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This means that many users have restricted choices for PWAs, which is a pity. A lack of experience in UX (user experience) is a genuine loss at least as important in a world as the marketing of the product itself.</p>



<p><strong>Lesser technical option</strong></p>



<p>It is not possible to apply to PWAs all technical alternatives, such as Bluetooth or Near Field Communication (NFC). This implies that the applications you may have for your application are restricted. The question is whether PWAs can also make use of other future advances.</p>



<h4 style="font-size:22px">Conclusion</h4>



<p>Using the Progressive Web App you have read the benefits and cons for development. In the end, it is vital that you have your application supported and solved problems on time by the proper PWA app development firm.</p>

<p>You may attract more clients to your businesses if you are careful with this element. After that, you will have the opportunity to do a timely analysis to enhance these services.</p>



<p>This field should not be forgotten that it is not static. That is why when it comes to generating income for your application you have to do your best progress.</p>



<p><strong>Boost Profits</strong></p>



<p>Typically, sales also improve as customer happiness increases. The more individuals with your product and business are engaged and happy, the more consumer demand will increase.</p>



<p>And if you can&#8217;t wait to receive a product from your consumers, let me guarantee you that this request will provide you some big returns.</p>

<p>You must understand the previous discussion on the importance of developing a mobile application to promote the brand, expand the accessibility of your services and raise your business sales.</p>



<p>So, I propose that you develop apps on both Android and iOS platforms if you have decided to make a mobile app. Both platforms are popular and your application may reach a pretty big number of users on these platforms.</p>

<p><strong>Native application</strong></p>
<p>Native applications are installed in an app store. They are particularly built for one platform and can use all smartphone capabilities, like the camera, GPS, speed meter, compass, contact list, etc.</p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color" style="font-size: 30px"><strong>React Native is better than Native?</strong></p>
<p>React native is better and unique because it has</p>
<ul>
<li>Lower the <strong>development time</strong></li>
<li>Easy for <strong>Web developers </strong></li>
<li>Cost-effective </li>
</ul>
<p>Native </p>
<ul>
<li>High <strong>development time</strong></li>
<li>High cost</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Development Time</strong></p>
<p>In a native application, you need two distinct teams to make your application available on both platforms, i.e. the Android development team and the iOS development team. This includes additional effort and time to create a mobile app.</p>
<p>In React Native&#8217;s instance, the same developer writes a single code for both platforms, which implies that React native applications may be created for Android and iOS using the same codes.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile App Cost</strong></p>
<p>The response to the cost of developing the mobile app also helps to find the suitable technology for the creation of your mobile app. The app creation using React Native is the top mobile app development firm, but the cost of Native App Development for the same app project may be reduced by 30%-35% in comparison.</p>
<p><strong>Scalability</strong></p>
<p>It offers mobile app developers more chances in comparison with Native technology to handle a greater quantity of work in an app and to publish higher-functionality updates. The winner in terms of scalability of the Native app vs the Reacts Native app is thus React Native.</p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color" style="font-size: 28px"><strong>React Native for Android Developers</strong></p>
<p>React Native is a smooth development in which the features of Native Code easily use, Hot Reloading, and the management of Hassle-free states lead to smooth, efficient, and efficient development.</p>
<p>A platform-sized experience, which boasts native Android and iOS components while the program runs, is the main advantage React Native offers.</p>
<p>This makes it possible for natives to manage the interaction even with a coding foundation written in JavaScript, so that memory, footprint, flexibility, and experience stay preserved.</p>
<p>It is compatible with native code. React Native is a structure that allows you to create the most powerful applications in combination with JavaScript. It offers impeccable performance with native components, guaranteeing that most applications operate seamlessly and native apps operate more often than before.</p>
<p>Reduce time to develop. Apart from open source projects, app developers might experience a 40 percent quicker development time because many elements can be used locally. Reaction Native also supports both Android and iOS, making it easy for both platforms to exchange data and a single code base. The task may therefore be accomplished in less time.</p>
<p>React Native comes with a Live Reload functionality which allows you to view the newest updates as soon as they are made. This makes it easy for the developer. We are passionate about online and mobile app development, we only advise our clients what is correct.</p>
<p>Find the ideal technological combination. You may use React Native to list your application in the Appstore and Playstore and make use of the sensors and device functionality and also wish to perform effectively. The first thing you want to do is to upgrade the mobile app and explore React Native.</p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color" style="font-size: 25px"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>In summary, therefore, you know to which end you are turning if you wish to build an ever-change multi-dimensional mobile app. From startups to successful business leaders, people embrace mobile applications instead of just websites. Most of you still know that mobile apps function totally differently from the standard website.</p>

			<p>Though <a href="https://www.hasotech.com/hybrid-mobile-app-development-considered-underrated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hybrid Mobile App development considered underrated</a>, There are still many Hybrid Mobile apps are being developed. Being Hybrid Mobile App Developers, <a href="https://www.hasotech.com/why-we-love-hybrid-mobile-app-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we love Hybrid Mobile App Development.</a> There are many popular apps like Amazon, Uber, Evernote, Facebook etc., The frameworks used to develop Hybrid apps makes Hybrid Mobile app developers easy to make it. To develop a successful mobile app, Hybrid Mobile app developers should follow some <a href="https://www.hasotech.com/secrets-successful-hybrid-mobile-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">secret methods</a>. Though there are many frameworks available to develop Hybrid Mobile apps like <a href="https://www.hasotech.com/ionic-mobile-app-developer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ionic Framework</a>, There are some tips for Hybrid Mobile App developers to follow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Choose the Right Framework</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>When going with Hybrid Mobile app development, Choosing the right framework to develop is very important. There are many frameworks available. Some of them are Ionic Framework, React Native, Xamarin, PhoneGap etc., The very confusion moment is choosing between Ionic Framework or React Native. Ionic Framework is on Angular 4 and React Native is on React js. Since both are booming in the market, It&#8217;s hard to choose the right one.</li>
<li>Anyways, The purpose of developing the Hybrid Mobile App can define it. If you are looking to develop both Web and Mobile app, Then our suggestion is to go with Ionic Framework. Since it is on Angular JS which can be used in both Web and Mobile App, Number of resources to be used can be reduced.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><a href="https://www.web.hasotech.com/why-we-love-hybrid-mobile-app-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">We Love Hybrid Mobile App Development</a></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a licensing Problem with React Native. It license says They can make it to full premium version anytime. So before choosing React Native, Make sure you can able to overcome the license problem.</li>
<li>If you are a .NET / C# Developer, Then the only option is Xamarin. Xamarin is a Microsoft product which uses C# as a base language to develop Hybrid Mobile app. Of course, You need Visual Studio tools to complete the development.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ionic Framework &#8211; Lazy Loading Issue</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are using Ionic Framework, Then you might be facing Lazy Loading issue in the new version. Still, Ionic Framework is working on it to overcome, There are some ways to fix the issue on our own. Instead of declaring all the Nodule Modules in the Main and pages where the node modules to be implemented. Declare the Node modules only in the pages. As the number of Node Modules increases on the Main page, The Lazy Loading time increases.</li>
<li>It is better to avoid unwanted node modules on the main page.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><a href="https://www.web.hasotech.com/not-go-hybrid-mobile-app-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Don’t go with Hybrid Mobile App Development</a></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Choosing the right Plugins</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>When we come to Hybrid Mobile App development, Definitely it is going to be on both Android and iOS and sometimes in Windows. While deploying the app to different platforms Plugins may get conflict. Some plugins may support only in Android and not on iOS.</li>
<li>Before choosing a plugin to implement the native function in Mobile App, Make sure it supports in all the platforms.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Checklist for Hybrid Mobile App Developers</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Before choosing Hybrid App, Make sure the requirement can be done in Hybrid. If there are more native functions or if the app is very complex, It is suggested to go with Native. But still, if you want to go with Hybrid, Then make sure the app is being developed with proper performance check.</li>
<li>Inspect the App in chrome browser and check for Network and console logs. Try creating the apps without any error in console logs. As the error increases, It may affect the performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.web.hasotech.com/hybridmobileapp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hybrid Mobile App Development </a></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Make proper performance check in the browser and Mobile App testing before deploying in Play store or App store.</li>
<li>If the mobile app is targeted for lower versions of Android or iOS, Then Hybrid App is not the right choice. Hybrid Apps are meant for Android Lollipop versions and above and iOS 10. Though it supports from Jellybean, It is suggested to with Lollipop target.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="stripe_2"><a href="https://www.hasotech.com/secrets-successful-hybrid-mobile-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Secrets of the Successful Hybrid Mobile Apps</a></h4>
<p>Progressive Web Apps are the next generation of web applications. Since the usage of mobile phones has been increased drastically. All the web applications are being developed with complete mobile optimized. But making the UI (User Interface) alone as mobile-optimized is not enough. There are lots of things to be considered for making a Mobile Optimized Web applications and that comes with Progressive Web Apps.</p>
<p>So what? <strong>Can a Hybrid Mobile App development help to make a Progressive Web Apps?</strong></p>
<p>Yes of course, why not? Hybrid apps are web nature.</p>
<h3>Hybrid Mobile App as Desktop App?</h3>
<p>And again the same answer, Why not? There are many Hybrid Desktop existing but the beauty part is. When you can deploy the code that you made for mobile application as a Desktop application. Hybrid Mobile App development can make it.</p>

<p>So, No worries about using Native functions in Hybrid Apps.</p>
<h3>What about Hybrid Mobile App Performance?</h3>
<p>Another main reason, Why some developers hesitate to use Hybrid platforms. When we compare the performance of Native Mobile Application and Hybrid Mobile Application, Always native performance is great. But it doesn&#8217;t mean that Hybrid Mobile app performance is very low. There might be some milliseconds lags between a Native and Hybrid Mobile applications. But is it possible to develop a Good standard application?  Experienced Hybrid Mobile app developer can make it.</p>

<h3>What is Hybrid Mobile App Development</h3>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">If you can able to deploy an application on multiple platforms like Android, iOS, Windows etc., with a single code. For Example, If we are about to develop <strong><a href="https://www.web.hasotech.com/how-to-get-free-magento-2-mobile-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Magento E-commerce Mobile Application</a> </strong>in Android iOS, Then probably Hybrid Mobile Application might be the right choice.  With this we can able to deploy the application on both Android and iOS. Whereas if we choose to go with Native Mobile Application development. Then both Android and iOS have to be developed separately. And also the cost and time of developing Native Mobile application would be high. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">The main reason is the Frameworks. Ther are many frameworks available to develop Hybrid Mobile applications like Ionic Framework, React Native, Xamarin, Titanium, and the mother of all frameworks, PhoneGap. Though there are many frameworks, All the frameworks are not good as to develop a standard application. There is licensing problem on using React Native since Facebook has said that, they will start charging for it anytime. Intel HTML5 fails to provide proper native functions and No updates with PhoneGap. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">These issues made Hybrid Mobile App Development Considered Underrated. But still, there are some good frameworks like <a href="http://ionicframework.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ionic Framework,</a> which provides regular updates and many trusted companies are using it.

And the range of developing multi-platform applications is also increasing. Cross platform mobile app development is not something web app. Creating web app is different and Creating Hybrid or cross platform mobile app development.
