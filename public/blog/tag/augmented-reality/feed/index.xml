			<h1>Get your Augmented Reality App for Android and iOS</h1>

The technology used in Augmented reality app is typical. There are many libraries and plugins are available. But choosing the right one for the Augmented reality app for Android and iOS is tough.</p>
<h3 class="stripe_2"><a href="https://www.hasotech.com/very-easy-to-develop-a-mobile-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Very easy to Develop a Mobile App</a></h3>
<h2>Augmented Reality App for Android and iOS</h2>
<p>If you are looking to develop Augmented Reality app for Android and iOS. Then the best way is to make Hybrid Mobile App. By which one can able to deploy single source on both Android and iOS.

<p>One of the best Augmented Reality library for Hybrid Mobile app is <a href="https://www.wikitude.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikitude</a>. Wikitude provides both Native and Hybrid Mobile App libraries.  With Wikitude, One can able to develop Augmented Reality App for Android and iOS. If you are looking for a complete native solution, You may use the same Wikitude. Or simply go with Unity framework which actually uses c# and javascript to develop AR Applications.</p>

<p>AR kit is also available in <a href="https://github.com/HippoAR/react-native-arkit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">React Native</a>. Which made very easier to develop iOS AR applications.
